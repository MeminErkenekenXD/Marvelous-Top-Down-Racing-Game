- **13 Unique Cars** :  All having varying *Styles and Stats*. They also have *Unique Engine Sounds*.

# Controls
* **Forward** : Throttle, which is used to accelerate.
* **Reverse** : Brake, which is used to slow down, or go in reverse if the car is stopped. However when going reverse, top speed is reduced.
* **Right/Left** : Used for steering.
* **Drift** : Hold drift to enhance steering with a tighter but more slippery turning arc without losing speed.
* **Reset** : Reset the car to the last checkpoint passed.

Key bindings can be displayed in game settings. 

# Mechanics
Car behaviour is based on three stats <BR>

**Top Speed** : Determines the cars top speed. <br>
**Acceleration** : Determines how fast the car accelerates. <br>
**Handling** : Determine how well car takes turns. <br>

**Speed System**

The car will gain speed as long as the player keeps applying throttle until it reaches its top speed (top speed stat).
The car has higher acceleration when it takes off, but when the car reaches its acceleration limit (acceleration stat). 
It will accelarate very slowly until it reaches top speed. Meaning if car has low high top speed but high acceleration,
it will accelerate very quickly but also hit its cap quickly. But if car has high top speed but low acceleration.
Car will take more time to reach its max speed requiring player to avoid mistakes while never letting go
of the throttle. But when car reaches high speeds the reward will be bigger.

**Turning System**

The car turns better when the player releases throttle , and it turns even better while braking.
However these actions reduces speed. In order to take sharp turns without losing speed, the player must master drifting.
Drifting allows the car to turn without losing speed. <br>

Both of these system goes hand in hand where skilled players are rewarded for understanding and mastering the cars, the tracks, and the game's system.

**Camera System**

Camera is designed to move relative to car's speed and position for player to get a more clear sight of what is ahead, it also gives a sense of motion. <br>

When the car stays still, it is approximately in the center of the screen.

However when the car starts reaching high speeds, camera pans back to increase the view field.
